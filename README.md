## About
Pickle is a lucnhtime buddy finder/casulal networking Power App for those who work in big organisations and what to meet new people from different depratmernts or are simply looking for a lunchtime jog buddy.

## Investigating target users and problem context with PACT analysis
To study the context of the proposed app and try to understand target users, it is best to use a structured framework like PACT (see [here](http://hci.ilikecake.ie/requirements/pact.htm) for details). PACT framework suggests the app is discussed in the context of **P**eople (target users), relevant **A**ctivities those people undertake, **C**ontext of such activities and **T**echnologies used. I omitted the full analysis to keep this brief but the guiding questions I tried to answer included:

* Who are the users? (Demographics, employment etc.)
* What is their level of tech proficiency?
* What motivates, pleases and engages the users, in particular with the current apps they use?
* Are we looking at frequent or infrequent users?
* What are the users' goals, tasks and actions?
* How are they currently performing those tasks? On what devices?
* Are these activites memorable? Are they done often?
* What is the social and organisational context of these tasks? How are similar tasks handled in the workplace - this is particularly important to discuss for a social app.

## Target persona
Ideally, the process of creating a persona would involve the target users themselves, for example through surveys and user stories. At this stage, this is not possible but any further development should definitely involve a more user-centric approach.

Based on PACT analysis, our target persona looks something like this:

He has been at this company for three years, ever since he graguated.  James is tech-savvy and spends a lot of time on his phone. He checks Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn daily on his smartphone on the way to work, during the day when he get bored and in the evening. From time to time, he uses dating apps; he's tried both Tinder and Bumble. Internally, he uses Teams and Yammer, mainly to discuss work and contaact people he doesn't know personally to ask specialist questions. He likes the simplicity of these interfaces and finds it easy to remember what to do when he hasn't used them in a long time (especially with the occasional use apps). James socialises with his colleagues regularly, ususally by grabbing a coffe after the morning standup and occasionally over lunch. He likes to chat to his immediate teammates during the day always attends lunch-and-learns when he has the time.

**James's problem**: 
o The persona’s current situation/problem. Consider what their journey or tasks looks like without the app.

* James likes meeting new people but often lacks the courage to approach someone he doesn't know well in the workplace. Although the company culture is friendly and welcoming, James finds himself unable to .... as he doesn't want to bother busy people or senior colleagues he doesn't know well. He expects a lot of people at the company feel the same way. He knows most people in his business unit and occasionally grabs a lunch with his team or one or two of his close colleagues. He finds himself having solitary lunches often due to everyones' differnt schedules and he wishes there was an easy way to meet someone outside his immediate business unit just for a chat. 

**Specific problems and situations**

* Currently, James doesn't have a way of approaching someone he doesn't know and asking them to get lunch - although they say you should "network" and approach new people, James knows that it doesn't always work and, in reality, some people might find it strange.
* James would love to have more opportunities to talk to senior people about advancing his career in general and about potentially moving to a different line of work within the organisation.
* He also loves learning from others and wishes there was a way to casually meet up wit differnt specialists across the organisation, be that to ask some specific questions about an introductory programming course he is taking or just see what the work is like in the rest of the organisation.
* James goes for lunchtime jogs or gym classes from time to time and would like to have an exercise buddy, but none of his colleagues are interested in exercising at lunchtime.
