## Investigating target users and problem context with PACT analysis
To study the context of the proposed app and try to understand target users, it is best to use a structured framework like PACT (see [here](http://hci.ilikecake.ie/requirements/pact.htm) for details). PACT framework suggests the app is discussed in the context of **P**eople (target users), relevant **A**ctivities those people undertake, **C**ontext of such activities and **T**echnologies used.

### People

### Activities

### Context

### Technologies

### Target persona
Before jumping to the target persona, it should be noted that, ideally, the process of creating a persona would involve the target users themselves, for example through surveys and user stories. At this stage, this is not possible but any further development should definitely involve a more user-centric approach.

Based on PACT analysis, our target persona looks something like this:

* James, 25, is a junior marketing specialist at large tech company in Sydney. He has been at this company for three years, ever since he graguated. He knows his business unit and occasionally grabs a lunch with his team or one or two of his close colleagues. 
* James is tech-savvy and spends a lot of time on his phone. He Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn daily, and he occaionaly uses Snapchat to check his friends' stories. From time to time, he uses dating apps (he's tried both Tinder and Bumble).
* James likes meeting new people but often lacks the courage to approach someone in the workplace. Although the company culture is friendly and welcoming, James finds himself unable to .... as he doesn't want to bother busy people or senior colleagues he doesn't know well. He expects a lot of people at the company feel the same way.

What he wants to do (problem statement)

Craft and describe the target persona for your app (approx. 10 – 50 words) – this could be yourself or a made-up person. Describe how your app will target / aid this particular persona (approx. 100 – 200 words). Good descriptions will include the following:

o The persona’s current situation/problem. Consider what their journey or tasks looks like without the app.

o Detail your app will satisfy the need/aid the persona, by making references to the specific features and functionalities you’ve included.
